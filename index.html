                <ol style="padding: 10px; font-size:18px;">Hello! I'm Aryan Kumar, an artist with a passion for creating intricate sketches and mandalas that convey stories and emotions.

                    I completed my 10th grade from the esteemed DAV Public School in Mokama, Bihar. During this time, I not only gained a solid education but also actively participated in extracurricular activities, further honing my skills in various fields.
                    
                    Following my exceptional performance in 10th grade, I pursued my 12th grade studies at Gyan Jyoti Residential Public School in Patna. <p></p>While maintaining a balanced approach to academics and other pursuits, I continued to demonstrate a keen interest in various subjects.
                    
                    Though I may describe myself as an average student, I believe that true learning goes beyond the confines of a classroom.<p></p> It is the combination of practical experiences and academic knowledge that shapes a well-rounded individual.
                    
                    Currently, I am in 4th year pursuing my B.Tech as Computer science student at SRM University in Delhi. Despite my academic pursuits, art has always been a fundamental part of my life.</ol>

                <ol style="padding: 10px; font-size:18px;">Through my drawings and detailed designs, I want to create art that's special and not just ordinary.

                    As a sketch and mandala artist, my goal is to make pieces that make you feel calm and help you learn about yourself. Every line and curve in my art is like an invitation to think deeply and understand your own feelings.
                    
                    The patterns in my art move gently, creating a peaceful feeling, like a quiet place in a busy world. My art is like a journey, a way to explore your own thoughts and feelings, like a safe space to take a break, think, and find comfort in the complex world around us.
                    
                    Today, I strive to elevate art's status, placing it on par with singing and dancing. Through my creations, I aim to ignite a deeper appreciation for artistic expression. Let's illuminate the art world together.
